<!-- <h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sanu Satyadarshi</h1> -->
<h1 align="center">I build software & lead engineering teams</h1>

I specialize in architecture, development, and deployment of cloud-native, microservices-based applications. 

Over time, Iâ€™ve moved beyond just writing codeâ€”Iâ€™ve led engineering teams, delivered complex projects, and aligned technology with business goals. I'm currently focused on **engineering leadership**, where I drive outcomes through a mix of engineering depth and people leadership.

I thrive in environments that value engineering excellence, operational discipline, and user empathy. Leading high-performance teams with a strong focus on innovation, quality, and impact is what keeps me motivated.

My responsibilities include:
- Managing and scaling engineering teams  
- Technical decision-making and mentoring  
- Project delivery and stakeholder alignment  

## Tech that I am currently working on

- [Python] â€“ To automate everything  
- [Golang] â€“ For microservice development  
- [Kubernetes] â€“ To run platforms at scale  
- [AWS] â€“ To run the applications  
- [Istio] â€“ For running Service Mesh at scale  

## Areas of Interest

- Highly distributed systems at scale  
- Improving latency and throughput at 4Cs (Cloud, Compute, Container, Code)  
- Infrastructure and application security in both Cloud and Hybrid environments  
- Sensible scaling with operational excellence  
- Hobbyist projects with Raspberry Pi  
- Sniffing system calls (Strace for life!!!)  


## How to work with me?
If you know how to improve this:
