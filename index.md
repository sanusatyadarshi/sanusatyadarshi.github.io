<!-- <h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sanu Satyadarshi</h1> -->
<h1 align="center">I build software</h1>


I am an engineering leader focused on building scalable products and platforms for global companies.

While I stay hands-on with architecture and development, I care just as much about aligning engineering efforts with product and business outcomes.

What drives me is creating high-impact systems -  *and* the high-performing teams behind them.

## What I focus on
- Building and leading engineering teams  
- Architecting cloud-native systems  
- Bridging product goals with technical strategy  

## Tech that I am currently working on

- [Python] â€“ To automate everything  
- [Golang] â€“ For microservice development  
- [Kubernetes] â€“ To run platforms at scale  
- [AWS] â€“ To run the applications  
- [Istio] â€“ For running Service Mesh at scale  

## Areas of Interest

- Highly distributed systems at scale  
- Improving latency and throughput at 4Cs (Cloud, Compute, Container, Code)  
- Infrastructure and application security in both Cloud and Hybrid environments  
- Sensible scaling with operational excellence  
- Hobbyist projects with Raspberry Pi  
- Sniffing system calls (Strace for life!!!)  


## How to work with me?
If you know how to improve this:
